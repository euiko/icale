# Roadmap

Here I make simple roadmap to better planning what to be done first and what next.
I hope this can help to keep in track as being overview about overall project.
For the development process, because it is more like a hobby project to spend a free time, it is likely no actual time when it will be done. Instead this roadmap just for guiding to keep in the right track.
Maybe it is enough by dividing it into smaller feature set to deliver, one after another so it is more easy to drive the idea changes :D.
